## This project allows a user to create simple images, known as SVGs, through a text-based interface. The user answers a series of questions about the image they want to create, such as its shape, color, and title. The software then uses this information to generate the image file in the SVG format. The project uses Node.js, a popular programming language, and additional tools to manage user input and write files. This project can be a helpful tool for generating custom images without requiring any graphic design skills.
